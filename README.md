# Get Closure on closures!
Nervous about being asked about closures or IIFEs at a job interview?

Don't be nervous, **be practiced!** With these **6 Closure Problems.** 

![Gif of closure quote from Friends](https://media1.giphy.com/media/jz0oM9Els8bHa/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c89a2ba6e75363449331774)

## Why?

Closures and IIFEs are TRICKY.

Instead of reading about them once, you can quiz yourself over and over again with this problem set. 

Currently, it focuses on IIFE applications, but more may be added soon. (Contributions welcome!)

## Usage

Copy all the problems from main.js into your IDE with a good terminal **OR** a tool like [Javascript Replit](https://repl.it/site/languages/javascript)

Then, one problem at a time - make a prediction on **WHAT you think will be logged** by the function.

After you make a prediction, comment out the function call, and run the code!

_If your prediction was correct_ - great! Next problem.

**If your prediction was incorrect** - STOP, learn more about closures, and don't continue until you are able to explain _WHY_ the code does what does. 

## Contributing

Do you have some Closure problems that are unaddressed by this problem set? 

Please make a Pull Request and I'll be happy to add :)
